Some Dotfiles
=============

Clone to your home dir to use these files.

Setup by running the ./setup.sh script from the directory where it lives.  It
should error if you call it from somewhere else, as there's some lazy
assumptions made about setup.sh living in the same dir as the dotfiles
themselves.
